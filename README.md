# Tweet Activated Crypto Trader

### Feb 14th 2021 - has been tested on DOGE/BTC (Kraken & Binance), DOGE/GBP, BTC/GBP (Binance), successfully made a 17%, 3% & 7% return from Elon's latest Doge tweets

The idea is to buy crypto using a Twitter trigger and sell after a user specified time / price / % gain e.g. when Elon musk tweets about Dogecoin

Markets, particularly small market cap altcoins are heavily influenced by individuals with large following 'hyping' up a cryptocurrency, crypto pumps. We can capitalize on this opportunity by being one of the first to exectue trades when a tweet is posted

When a Tweet is posted, it checks for substring matches with keywords for a particular cryptocurrency

These keywords and coins can be user specified

To configure on local system: \
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To run with Binance: \
`python twitter_binance.py`

To run with Kraken: \
`python twitter_kraken.py` 

API keys are kept in a json, one directory up from repo ../keys.json
```
{
    "twitter_keys":{
        "consumer_key":"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
        "consumer_secret":"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
        "access_token_key":"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
        "access_token_secret":"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    },
    "binance_keys":{
        "api_key":"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
        "secret_key":"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    },
	"kraken_keys":{XXXXXX}
}
```

## To Do
- User input parameters (done)
- Error handling if trade is unclosed (done)
- Fully implement Binance (lower taker/maker fees < 0.1% compared to Krakens 0.26%) (done)
- Trade logging json mechanism (done)
- Verify working using BTC transactions (done)
- Reduce latency between tweet and trade to 2s (done)
	- Use 1 query/s or using multiple keys to get n/s for faster buy execution (done)
	- Look at streaming Twitter, streams can get multiple users rather than just 1 every second (slower ~ 5s))
		- Integrate streaming
	- Selenium scraper (slow)
	- Requests module (doesn't work with Twitter)
- Get a list of accounts to follow and trade ideas
- Handle Retweets vs. Tweets (done)
- Create keyword list in text file
	- Keyword confidences = position size
- Test for multiple other alt coins
- Test when ticker symbols are reversed
- Work out the amount to buy for each alt
	- Find a reasonable amount to trade based of previous exchange rates in Â£/$
	- Keep a list of exchange rates in mem or in text file and update a a certain freq / at the start
- Implement for any  previously untraded alt coin if listed on Binance or Kraken
- Implement more sell options
	- Specified % gain
	- Limit order at a price target
	- Trailing stop losses (Can use ccxt for this)
- Machine Learning features
	- Sentiment feature
		- For size of position 
		- Shorting
	- Look at interpreting images (CV for text extraction, object detection on memes)


## Notes
- Requires a Twitter Developer API detecting tweets through Tweepy
- Requires a crypto exchange (Kraken/Binance) API which is used through ccxt (cryptocurrency exchange trading library)
	- ccxt allows universal function calls to be used on multiple exchanges (adding a new exchange should not be difficult)
